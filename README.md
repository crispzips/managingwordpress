# Maintaining Your Wordpress Site
The Wordpress necessities, for everyone

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) [content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) and online publishing platform.

While Wordpress is certainly simpler and more intuitive than building sites from scratch using html/css/php, it still has its fair share of whizzbangs, doodads, and mumbojumbo to stymie your creative process.

This tutorial will help you navigate the Wordpress user interface so that you can harness its core functionality.

[Here are some examples of what you can do with Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/showcase/)

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes you have already registered with Wordpress and generated a site, or had someone help you generate your first site, and now the reins are in your hands. If you haven't done so, there are lots of [great tutorials](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/wordpress-installation.htm) to help you with this process.

## The Administrator View

Once you have a Wordpress account and site, you can access the administive view by appending "/admin" to the end of your site's url.
* For example: "[yourwebsite.wordpress.com]/admin"

If you are not automatically logged-in, you will be asked to do so at this point.

After you log in, you will see your site, with the administrative interface laid on top, like this:
