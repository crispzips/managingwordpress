# Maintaining Your WordPress Site with [SiteOrigin Page Builder](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/)
The WordPress necessities, for everyone

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) [content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) and online publishing platform.

While WordPress is certainly simpler and more intuitive than building sites from scratch using html/css/php, it still has its fair share of whizzbangs, doodads, and mumbojumbo to stymie your creative process.

This tutorial will help you navigate the WordPress user interface so that you can harness its core functionality.

[Here are some examples of what you can do with WordPress](https://wordpress.org/showcase/)

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes you have already registered with WordPress and generated a site, or had someone help you generate your first site, and now the reins are in your hands. If you haven't done so, there are lots of [great tutorials](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/wordpress-installation.htm) to help you with this process.

## The Admin View

Once you have a WordPress account and site, you can access the administive view by appending "/admin" to the end of your site's url.
* For example: "[yourwebsite.wordpress.com]/admin"

For this tutorial I'll be using the [Capra/Bailey Project](http://caprabaileyproject.oucreate.com) created by [Ben Keppel](http://history.ou.edu/ben-keppel) and [Tara Carlisle](https://libraries.ou.edu/users/tara-carlisle) at the University of Oklahoma. 

If you are not automatically logged-in, you will be asked to do so at this point.

After you log in, you will see your site, with the administrative interface laid on top, like this:

**For ease of navigation, Wordpress has several redunancies built in. There are multiple ways to perform many of the operations, multiple buttons to get to the same place. Don't be confused by these reduncancies. For example the site theme, widgets, and menus can be adjusted through the "Customize" interface, or they can be accessed from the dropdown menu labeled with your site's title, or they can be managed from the appearance section of the dashboard -- all perform the same functions, it's just a matter of personal preference and accessibility.**

* The WordPress icon will take you to the WordPress current version homepage where you can learn about the WordPress capabilities now at your disposal. If you hover over it, you can:
  * Learn "About WordPress"
  * Visit WordPress.org
  * Access tutorials, the API, and plugins through the "Documentation" tab
  * Visit the "Support Forums" to connect with users like yourself with questions like yours
  * Give "Feedback" to WordPress
  
* The next tab (with the speedometer icon and your website's title) allows you to access:
  * the "Dashboard"
  * the "Themes" manager
  * the "Widgets" manager
  * the "Menus" manager
(More on each of these later)

* The "Customize" tab (with the paintbrush icon) allows you to manage:
  * "Site Identity"
    * where you can change the site title, tagline, and icon
  * "Colors"
    * background and accent colors
  * "Logo"
  * "Header Image"
  * "Background Image"
  * "Menus"
  * "Widgets"
  * Front Page Settings
  * "Additional CSS"
    * for customizing your site using [cascading style sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) commands

** The great thing about the "Customize" interface is that it allows you to preview the changes you're making in real time, so you can tweak your site with precision and awareness.

* The comments tab (speech bubble icon) allows you to view and manage comments to your site
  * the number beside the speech bubble icon is an alert for new icons
  * you can approve, delete, search for, or mark icons as spam

* The "New" tab (+ icon) allows you to quickly and conveniently add a new:
  * post
  * media file
  * link
    * including its advanced metadata relationships
  * page
  * or site user
* The "Edit Page" tab (pencil icon) allows you to edit the page you're currently on
  * You can edit pages by navigating to them using menus and then clicking this "Edit Page" button, or by going to the "Pages" tab in the Dashboard
* The right-most button in the Admin interface is the "Live Editor"
  * It is a condensed form of the page editor (the tab to the left of it) that, like the "Customize" interface, allows you to see the changes you're making in real time
